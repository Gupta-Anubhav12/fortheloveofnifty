**Money Multiplier** <br/>
**snippet** The RBI has the power to control the amount of money you have in your pocket, Read till end to find out how>><br/>

The Reserve Bank Of INDIA (RBI) holds a meeting after every two months to announce it's regulating policy called Monetry Policy. Monetry Policy is a tool of RBI to control inflation and ensure a healthy growth of GDP.<br/>
To understand this we need to know about the Need of money and types of money:<br/>
People need liquid money for 4 motives:<br/>
1. Transaction Motive :to Purchase goods and services of daily needs<br/>
2. Precautionary motive: To avoid sudden emergency cash crunch<br/>
3. Impulsive purchase: To purchase something out of sudden <br/>
4. Speculative Motive: To speculate on prices and wait for price to lower and then purchase<br/>

So there is demand of money but with demand there also exist some reserves or places where money is stored: These are classified as follows:<br/>

1. A->Currency/cash
2. B->Demand Deposit/(deposit where we can withdraw anytime on demand i.e. Savings account or Liquid funds<br/>
3. C->Fixed assets/Time deposits(We can not withdraw money immediately)

here **A and B** form a class of money called **M<sub>1</sub>**(narrow money) this is the most liquid form of money that flows in market.<br/>
the savings deposits + M<sub>1</sub> =M<sub>2</sub>
The fixed deposits in when added to M<sub>1</sub> becomes M <sub>3</sub>(broad money)

Hence The Job of RBI is to maintain a delicate balance between these all M<sub>1</sub> M<sub>2</sub>& <sub>3</sub>. This balance ensure that the flow of money in market is regulated and inflation is under controll    <br/>
**M<sub>0</sub>** is called the High Powered money. Isn't all money same?? my ten rupees and your ten rupees?? aren't they same? <br/>
maybe yes maybe no :)<br/>
there comes a role of **Money Multiplier**<br/>
better understood by this hypothetical scenerio<br/>
but before it there's a term called<br/> 
**CRR** (Cash reserve ratio) this is a basic ratio which is defined ny the reserve bank of India for banks to maintain a percentage of amount they get as deposits to avoid any future cash runs, where people run to bank for cash.Because if a bank gives loan of each penny that it recieves as deposit then the regular functioning of bank would stop, or the bank may crash. Hence maintaining CRR is strictly important..<br/>
suppose in a banking system RBI release a 100 rupees but the CRR stands at 10% then the money that is realised in market get's multiplied by 100/CRR , so in our case the money that reaches market is 1000 whereas RBI released only 100 rupees ....HOW???

Imagine RBI released 100 rupees in market through a bank,Banks has to keep 10 as CRR but release loan of 90 to me, I purchase a car from dealer - Bholla Singh and he goes to his bank where he deposits 90 he recieved from me. Now the Bholla Singh's bank keeps 10%of 90 as CRR i.e 9 and releases 81 as loan.
this cycle continues and a amount of 1000 is realised in Market whereas RBI released only 100. Also note that the original 100 end up lying in CRR <br/>
In a functional Economy the money multiplier must always be more than 1<br/>
there are many leaks in this system in practical life but it gives us a feel that how sensitive the management of money is....<br/>
..Keep reading this daily and you'll be money indepenent by the end of this lockdown...
<br/> Tommorow We will start with basic ratioes and terms of Monetry Policy....<br/>
Thanks for Reading
